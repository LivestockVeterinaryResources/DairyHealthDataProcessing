<!-- The objective of this milestone is to start the creation of a
template you can use for reproducible reports going forward. Most of
this milestone will focus on customizing the look of the report that you
can use for future reports. We will also explore of the lameness data as
part of this and build on the denominator stuff from week 5. It is
likely that you will use this template in future milestones.
A few notes:  1) The logo contains a clickable link 3) to use an image put it in the image folder 3)Any data (including farm name) that is reported in the text should use an inline text code chunk -->

# Report for `r farm_name`

-   This report shows data from the past year from **`r date_min_pull`
    to `r date_max_pull`**.

## Events reported

In the data set there were:

1.  `r number_lame` lame events record this year

2.  `r number_trim` trim events.

## Objective

We will start by exploring the lameness events reported in the data.

Your objective is to recreate the analysis show below.

-   For @fig-explore_lame the scale is viridis (of course :) )

-   To get na's to show up as black you need to use the na.value
    argument in scale_fill_viridis_d().
    
### Explore recorded lameness/trim protocols

-   Use the protocols_letters1 variable to get the information about the
    lameness/trim protocols used.


```{r}
#| label: fig-explore_lame
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Lameness Protocols Used in the Past Year"

# I hid my code to give you some coding to do this week 
# but your code should show up here

plot <- lame_protocol_graph()

plot


```

### NA exploration

Let's explore the NA's to see if there's a pattern



```{r}
#| label: na-lame-events
#| echo: true

# put your code to explore NA's here
na_lame_events <- na_explore()

# we will learn better ways to show tables later but for now this works
rmarkdown::paged_table(na_lame_events)

```

# Extension

For this week extension create a template for your future reports

-   customize the report to use your business' logo

-   use a theme/font colour scheme you prefer
