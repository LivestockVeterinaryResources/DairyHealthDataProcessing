# Load your packages here

library(tidyverse) #this includes many packages and is the main package used in nearly all data wrangling
library(arrow) #this package handles parquet files
library(skimr) #this is particularly helpful when looking at new data or finding NA values
library(waldo) #we use this to create answer keys for these exercises


```

## Read and Visualize

In this milestone, you'll use ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of age_left for a subset of the data. But before you begin, you'll need to import the animals data set. Unlike with Milestone 1, the animals data set has not been pre-loaded for you to use in R.


## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

In the code chunk below, use a command from the arrow package to read in the animals data set.

* The animals data set lives in the file `animals.parquet` (think of parquet as just another file extension like .csv, or .doc), which is stored in the `data/intermediate_files` folder in your working directory.  However, this quarto document lives in a folder below the working directory, so when you call the file path you need to use "../" at the beginning of the path to tell it to look for the path beginning one level higher than where this quarto document is stored. 

* Save the data set as an object in your environment named `animals`.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-import
#hint the function to read in a parquet file is the same as the code to read a csv file except replace 'csv' with 'parquet'

animals<-read_parquet('../data/intermediate_files/animals.parquet')


```

### Part 2 - Visualize

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot. 


```{r}
#| label: recreate-this
#| message: false

ggplot(animals%>%filter(age_left>365))+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age_left), color = 'red')
  
ggsave('images/milestone02.png')

knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone02.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above. Before plotting, you will first need to filter your data set to only include observations from cattle where age_left is more than 1 year.


```{r}
#| label: recreation-visualize



```




## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the visualization skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. How does the distribution of age_left differ between breeds? Consider exploring these distributions with other geoms.
2. What relationships do you see between age_left and other variables of interest in the data set?
3. [any other research question of interest]

Alternately, working with a data set of your own, complete the following: 

1. Read in your data
2. Filter your data using a logical test/condition 
3. Graph this data subset using at least one geom 



```{r}
#| label: extension

animals2<-animals%>%
         mutate(outcome = case_when(
           is.na(date_left)~'active', 
           is.na(date_sold)>0~'sold', 
           is.na(date_died)>0~'died',
           TRUE~'error'))%>%
  mutate(year_born = floor_date(date_birth, unit = 'year'))%>%
  mutate(left_as_calf = age_left<365)

colors_outcome<-c("active" = 'green',  "died" = 'red',   "error" = 'orange',  "sold" = 'blue' )

ggplot(animals2%>%
         filter(outcome %in% c('died', 'sold'))%>%
         filter(!(is.na(left_as_calf))))+
  geom_point(aes(x = year_born, y = age_left), 
             position = position_jitter(), 
             size = .2, 
             alpha = .2)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = year_born, y = age_left, 
                   fill = outcome, group = year_born), 
               alpha = .8, 
               position = position_dodge2())+
  facet_wrap(outcome~left_as_calf, scales = 'free')+
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_outcome)+
  scale_color_manual(values = colors_outcome)


```
