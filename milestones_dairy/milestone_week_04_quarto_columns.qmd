# This chunk is already finished for you, you don't need to modify anything here
library(tidyverse) #this includes many packages and is the main package used in nearly all data wrangling
library(arrow) #this package handles parquet files
library(skimr) #this is particularly helpful when looking at new data or finding NA values
library(waldo) #we use this to create answer keys for these exercises

solution_columns<-read_rds('data_milestones/solutions_week4_check_columns.rds')


#add some extra functions

```

## Create and select columns

In this milestone, you'll write some of the code that was written for you in milestone 3.

1.  The events_formatted.parquet file is read in, named "events" in your environment, and filtered for health events. Filter this further so you only have only one or 2 unique health events. The example in the solution is based on 'NAVEL' and 'SEPTIC' events, but choose anything you want.
2.  create a new variable in events named **floordate_month**. The logic to create this variable is: **floor_date(date_event, 'months')**
3.  arrange the events by 3 variables: the animal (id_animal), the event (event), and then the event date (date_event).
4.  Pipe your events to the function fxn_add_event_counts(). This will add columns indicating the number of times the animal has had that event within the data set (event_count_animal) or within their lactation (event_count_lact). If you would like to see the code the creates these click on the function in your environment.
5.  create a new variable the is animal age in days at time of event. Name this variable "age_event"
6.  select all the variables below in the order you see them in the solution_columns table in your environment

```{r}
#| label: recreation-import
#| 
events<-read_parquet('../data/intermediate_files/events_formatted.parquet')%>%
  filter(event_type %in% 'health')




```

## Check selected columns

```{r}


waldo::compare(colnames(events), colnames(solution_columns))

```

### Step 2 - Disease and Treatments

Create 2 new variables for your events: Disease and Treatment. Use case_when() and whichever columns you would like to create the best description. Then use graphs, tables, or a combination to describe the timing your selected Disease(s), both over time and according to animal age or dim as appropriate. Show if there has been a change in the treatments used over time.

Below are a couple example graphics, but yours can be prettier.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this
#| message: false


knitr::include_graphics('images/milestone4_disease_over_time.jpg')
knitr::include_graphics('images/milestone4_disease_by_phase.jpg')



```

### Extension Options

1)  Improve your description for your chosen events
2)  Choose a new disease
3)  choose to add multiple farms (either your own data or other example herds)
